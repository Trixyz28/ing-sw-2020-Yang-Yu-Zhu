## System Requirements
This application requires Java 14 to run.  
To visualize the client CLI correctly, the chosen terminal should support UTF-8 characters.  
Recommended screen resolution: 1920x1080 or higher.


## How to create executable files
Server.jar and Client.jar can be created with Maven Shade Plugin, through the command
```sh
mvn clean package
```

## How to run the application
  
### Server
```sh
java -jar Server.jar [port]
```
If there is no port number specified, the server will automatically use the default one (45000).

### Client
Double-click on Client.jar will launch the GUI.
As an alternative, it is possible running the client through
```sh
java -jar Client.jar [parameter]
```
If the parameter is null, the GUI will be launched. Otherwise, it will active the CLI.
